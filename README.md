2.[Weighted Rating__Naive Bayes__SVM](https://github.com/yaodehong/Book-Recommender/blob/master/2_Weighted%20Rating_Naive%20Bayes_SVM.ipynb)

On the website of goodreads.com, each book has a score which was denoted by "A bookâ€™s total score is based on multiple factors, including the number of people who have voted for it and how highly those voters ranked the book." I could not find the formula it uses and find the weighted rating formula applied by IMDB as follows:

Weighted Rating (WR) = $(\frac{v}{v + M} . r) + (\frac{M}{v + M} . C)$

where,
* *v* is the number of ratings for the book
* *M* is the minimum number of ratings required to be listed in the chart
* *r* is the average rating of the book
* *C* is the average rating across the whole dataset

I use the above formula to generate the book weighted raing score:
